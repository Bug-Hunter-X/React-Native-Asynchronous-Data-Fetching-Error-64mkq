# React Native Asynchronous Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving asynchronous data fetching within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  Improper handling of asynchronous operations can lead to unexpected behavior, such as rendering components with undefined or null state values, resulting in crashes or blank screens.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code snippet showing the incorrect handling of the asynchronous `fetch` operation.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version demonstrating best practices for fetching data and handling potential errors.

This example is useful for understanding how to properly manage asynchronous tasks in React Native to prevent common data-related issues.
